This is where the advanced sensor called the MTF M8 is coming into play, it's a more accurate (and accurate in the way it measures distance) alternative to the laser rangefinder. By measuring the speed at which an object moves, such as the angle between the laser and your eye, the MTF M8 will determine the speed at which you can get into and out of the target. By measuring the accuracy of this sensor, which is based on the motion signals it receives from the target, the laser rangefinder can be measured to ensure you are within an acceptable target range. The laser rangefinder is useful for everything that a handgunner needs to know about",

With the rangefinders, you can measure this distance to any accuracy, which gives you a reliable means to find exactly where you are going and you can also compare your measurements.\n\nIn addition to measuring the distance, laser rangefinders can also measure elevation and horizon, which is particularly useful because one can see through the clouds.

Banned in America was his fourth film. Roloff told PBS \"Frontline\" he's never regretted having made the film. He said religious people today are getting a hold of the facts of his life and the church culture of his day.\n\n\"The problem today isn't so much",
            "1": " Christi, Tex. Roloff was a staunch advocate for the civil rights of gay people, who often had to hide the sexuality of themselves and their families out of fear of retribution from their parents. Roloff started a ministry at Corpus Christi's John Birch Society, which would provide free services to young gay people. But not everyone was enamored with his approach.\n\n\"Most of the people in our community came [to our ministry], and they just were scared, they wouldn't want us there,\" said Bill Schindler, who worked with Roloff at the John Birch Society. \"There were lots of homophobic people in my church.\"\n\nRoloff's marriage to Janey Hamer at the time was a bit more public. The couple lived together, where she began a sexual relationship with another woman. Both Roloff and Hamer later claimed a lack of religious discrimination against gays. Roloff and Hamer are not married and the pair",
            "2": " Christi called the Texas Village. He and fellow missionaries took more than 40 young people as they came of age, giving them opportunities to meet and socialize with others of their age in a Christian community.\n\nWhen the church was finally shut down in the late '90s, Roloff was put on trial charged with violating the state's anti-sodomy statutes. In 1995, he was convicted of violating the anti-sodomy statute and sentenced to 15 years in prison, with a life sentence suspended during his mandatory pre-service religious education.\n\nRoloff, who has since remarried and adopted 17 children, has spent nearly half his adult life incarcerated. Many of his charges have been overturned due to lack of evidence.\n\n\nLast summer, attorneys hired by Roloff successfully challenged his conviction and sentence by arguing that his imprisonment was a violation of his First Amendment rights not to be compelled to perform \"official acts related to religious practices.\"\n\nIn"

A shock of power would eventually make its way to the drive wheels, sometimes mid-corner. Turbo lag is notoriously finicky (and in the case of old race cars, a killer) and automakers have been working on ways to reduce or eliminate it. Volvo has its own solution and it involves a bit of engineering that we need explained.\n\nThe system is called Power Pulse, and it works with the help of an air compressor and an electric motor. The motor waits for the driver to ask for more power, and it keeps the air compressor tank ready to go with clean air pulled in from the intake. When the throttle is pressed, the air tank can then force compressed air into the exhaust manifold and send it along with the exhaust gases to spool up the turbo.\n\nThis is almost similar to what the Fast and Furious crew would be doing when they hit their \"",

            "0": " However, this method resulted in a greater air intake and so caused higher temperatures to the crankcase. This required smaller, lighter, more efficient air intakes. This caused more power, but it also took more breathing. As a result, the turbo lag became so high that it meant that the engine could not get to maximum performance. Turbocharging, on the other hand, uses a smaller engine, so there is less air to work through; all we need for the engine to run is air. This means that turbocharging allows more power, which then results in less turbo lag.\n\nIn today's cars, the air coming out of the turbochargers is not exactly fresh air. Rather, it is made from \"hot\" air, which heats up quickly. At that point, the turbocharger pressure (which is not nearly as high as when used to push out massive amounts of air) is high enough to cause the turbo to lag. To combat this problem, today's cars use",
            "1": "\n\nThe early turbocharged engines were built by General Motors, Volvo and Ford. As engine and cooling technology improved, and prices came down, companies like GM and Ford sold their parts to companies like General Motors (GM), Chrysler and Ford. In the mid 1960s, as the American housing market began to falter and prices for new cars began to spike, major corporations started to buy up a limited number of turbocharger and supercharger kits that they used to build their own small-block engines.\n\nIt wasn't until the mid-1990s that all of the major carmakers had their own stock of turbocharged units, which were then reissued by different manufacturers as part of their respective powerplants. GM now makes engines with a set of four-cylinder engines with a 5.5-liter V-8 and its own TurboSquirt supercharger. Ford and other automakers with a large number of stock parts were not quite ready to start selling their own",
            "2": " As the years have gone on, turbo lag has become a greater and greater danger for newer and \"un-compromised\" cars, which are powered by far smaller turbochargers that feed their pistons far less air (and thus produce much more power) and are therefore likely to experience greater lag. For that reason, owners of older cars, when they have the option of installing a new turbocharger, usually choose not to; they are simply afraid of how much lag they are likely to experience if their car is fitted with a new (or old) turbocharger.\n\nA turbocharger is simply a high-pressure system in the engine that combines water and jet fuel to expel a high-pressure jet. The pressure is maintained by a vacuum-powered fan-like nozzle in the engine. While the pressure is being exerted by the engine, the fan sucks air into the system.

I've also been thinking about the benefits of networking over cable and how that's changed what it means to be connected.\n\nI've seen the myths that surround wireless networking, and decided to have a look at the facts. A brief comparison with the past can help determine if these claims are true.\n\nBack in the day, wireless networks weren't built around a computer. Instead, a small PC or \"smartphone\" connected to the network over a PC protocol, such as WEP or WPA. Later, when wireless networking became common in the late nineties, it was called \"wireless N\", and was more like a cellular network. However, with the advent of WLAN, wireless networking started to be considered much more in line with the",

One such myth is the term \"Wi-Fi.\" It's actually a little misleading for its root cause.\n\nWi-Fi is just the abbreviation for \"Universal WIFI.\" This stands for \"Web Interface for Integrated Wireless Access Points.\" In layman's terms, it enables you to access the Internet from the local area network, i.e. the wireless network. In a typical computer setup, the computer is connected to a wired network by its modem and Wi-Fi connection uses a cable or modems to link the computer to the local area network. The modem supplies the Internet connection, while the wireless network connects the computer to your Internet service provider. This is often referred to as the fixed network, or WAN.\n\nWi-Fi is quite simple. Think of it as an Internet Protocol (IP) connection, which is a set of three basic rules:\n\nThe first rule says that the network on which you are connected has to be in range"

Perhaps if Romney had never left the private sector, worked as an attorney and been elected governor of Massachusetts, his political r\u00e9sum\u00e9 would have looked less like an episode of Seinfeld and more like a biography of an American business mogul. Instead, Romney has spent the last two years battling Romneycare, Romney's signature health care overhaul, which he has championed for the past eight years and has refused to repeal."

This is another way the \"prefer-everything\" motivation could come in useful. Another reason may be that the interface and semantics of an algorithm are more easily specified, and so are the resulting types. This is a common pattern in algorithms (e.g. the way a binary search tree is implemented).

The verb to crib in the sense of plagiarism or stealing another's schoolwork is mainly British English, though both US and British English know crib notes. Both varieties of English share the sense of a barred container or rack for animal fodder, a manger.

Today, AMD has less than 1% of the market, which is one of the reasons it's so eager to rejoin that particular fight. Intel's data center business was worth $17.2 billion in 2016, up 8% from 2015. If AMD can capture 5% of that business, that's $860 million of additional revenue per year, and it's revenue that comes with a nice margin.\n\nAMD's Naples",

When you have so many different environments, you need an approach where you have a set of things to choose from to get a certain level of performance. For example LAMP offers a different build for each environment (i.e. each database) while PHP 7.1 still has a completely different syntax for everything.

We first acquire images of the face from a small set of viewpoints under a dense sampling of incident illumination directions using a light stage. We then construct a reflectance function image for each observed image pixel from its values over the space of illumination directions. From the reflectance functions, we can directly generate images of the face from the original viewpoints in any form of sampled or computed illumination. To change the viewpoint, we use a model of skin reflectance to estimate the appearance of the reflectance functions for novel viewpoints. We demonstrate the technique with synthetic renderings of a person's face under novel illumination and viewpoints.\n\nThe Paper\n\nSIGGRAPH 2000 Conference Proceedings The Movie\n\nSIGGRAPH 2000 Electronic Theater The Demo\n\nSIGGR",

Recently, several experiments have been completed using the ability to create the illusion of a human reflection in images of natural landscapes, including images of faces being scanned with computer-assisted vision, as well as in 3D and computer-generated images. Here, the authors investigate how to do this, using a process called face imaging and a method of computer-assisted reflection retrieval that generates accurate views of facial features. These techniques make the creation of realistic human reflections easier than in previous investigations. Using both methods, the authors can create a face that is indistinguishable in a computer-based image and then apply the same techniques to create the illusion of a face.

With eye tracking, we can use a nonlinear representation, such as sincrose/bright-circle (S/BC), to estimate the eye-contrast of a face. We then observe that, when using S/BC to estimate contrast with the average face, sincrose/BC is able to detect the difference between the average face and the average eye, and to provide a strong indicator of eye-contrast. Here, we demonstrate the ability to extract contours of the top half of the eye and show that even after filtering sincrose to lower contrast, sincrose still provides useful information that may reduce misclassification of the eyes without using further filtering.\n\nIntroduction\n\nContrast is a fundamental cognitive mechanism that underlies the"

While apprenticeships used to be a very common way for people to train for a wide variety of professions, as higher education became ubiquitous, the apprenticeship model fell out of fashion.\n\nHowever, both universities and employers are starting to recognize that practicing skills in a real-life setting reinforces classroom learning, makes students more employable upon graduation, and can reduce student indebtedness. #Win-win-win.\n\nHow do apprenticeship",

Worse, federal loan borrowers don't discover that their government loans are in default either \u2013 meaning that they couldn't receive a reasonable amount of forgiveness or forbearance.\n\nIt costs students and taxpayers billions of dollars every year to subsidize debt, and the federal government already collects $2 billion in interest money on federal student loans. All we need to do is tell students that they can refinance their debt or take a more flexible repayment plan and it'd be a big step towards getting better access to education.\n\nThere is an easier method to getting government student loans out of their default \u2013 one that's already available to everyone else.\n\nHow it Works: Refinancing or Borrowing a Loan on Time"

A point-to-point bus connects only two bus devices together. A shared bus can be used by more than two bus devices. Thus the number of buses required for communication depends on whether point-to-point or shared buses are used. For example, four bus devices require six point-to-point buses to communicate with each other, but four bus devices can communicate through a single shared bus.

That is why I was appalled and repulsed by Lynne Featherstone MP, who at the Lib Dem Conference today used the exact inverse analogy to make a rhetorical point.:\n\n\"It's a practice that has been going 4,000 years and, without wishing to be crude about this, quite frankly if it was boys' willies that were being cut off without anaesthetic it wouldn't have lasted four minutes, let alone 4,000 years.\"\n\n",

As a woman who's spoken out against FGM, I feel like that's what one means when they say \"feminists have to stop talking about women's genital mutilation as if it's a 'normal practice'\" and that \"there's a difference between taking one of a thousand newborn genitals and cutting it into little bits so it can't",

This is particularly so in Africa. As women who have seen what the procedure can do to a child, we are all aware of the horrific pain and suffering it causes. These women are not afraid to tell us about the problems that occur with female circumcision: the trauma, the disfigurement to the genitalia of the girl, and the physical and, often, psychological scars of the operation.\n\n"

The only other team to be outshot in the third period for more than two minutes was the Minnesota Wild on Thursday.\n\nAs you might expect, the Vancouver Canucks have had their share of struggles over the past few months.

Of the teams that are currently in the top 40 in overall possession, only two are within five points. The Detroit Red Wings and the Anaheim Ducks.\n\nHow is the goal of possession better served with the puck down low? As a Canucks fan, this is my only reason for why the Canucks have remained successful (for the majority of their long playoff run) \u2013 to be better placed offensively. But as a hockey fan, what are your reasons for opposing possession? What do you use to gain better positions and a bigger advantage over the opponents that are trying to hold the puck for dear life?\n\nIt is a simple question with more nuance than you probably would like to know"

However, this also means that some of the improvements made with the PoW will be lost if we adopt the soft limit.\n\n\nHere's an article by Bruce Schneier on the topic. I would add a few changes. One of them is that he argues that the \"normal\" PoW code is really just a way of storing arbitrary data in hash-based inputs to the protocol.

It's all relative to the standard deviation \u2014 an estimator that looks at some number and applies another value, to see where it falls.\n\nYou typically want a player to trade for 5 or 10 wins above his replacement level to get a better return.

        "reference_text": "the groupings into which society is divided\" and \"the technical processes of labour\". What is less well known is that Marx theorizes the unity of these two moments (social groupings and technical processes) as constituting \"a specifically capitalist mode of production\" (our emphasis). Taken in isolation from the technical processes of labour the social groupings (i.e. wage-labourers and capitalists) constitute what Marx calls a formal subsumption of labour under capital; but on the basis of this formal subsumption there is erected a set of \"methods,means and conditions\" of production which Marx terms the real subsumption of labour under capital. This is elaborated at length in Marx's recently published Results of the Immediate Process of Production (the so-called 'lost chapter' of Capital) - but the same perspective is abundantly clear in Capital itself, as was demonstrated nearly twenty years ago in the article by Raniero Panzieri printed below.\n\nBorn in Italy",

Thus the two aspects of capitalist technology that Marx identifies as the two drivers of the system are:\n\n1) the development of a new human nature: in particular new forms of culture, and in particular new forms of social organization.\n\n2) the development of the productive forces: in particular the development of the productive power of labour as a whole, in particular industrialization and mechanization.\n\nMarxists have been trying to understand the role of the former. They have attempted to apply Marx's ideas about \"technological\" processes, such as automation, new technologies, and technologies of production, with a Marxist methodology and analysis. In the second part of chapter 7 of his book, entitled \"The Fundamental Transformation of Society\", the writer explains what he interprets by the term: \"The fundamental transformation, therefore, of the social and economic forms through which social production",
            "1": "individual\" human beings and the whole social system in which they live. The \"individual man\" becomes subject to social coercion, whereas the \"collective human being\" becomes \"freely autonomous\" in relation to its environment and other individuals and things.\n\nBut it has been recently claimed that Panzieri's views are not Marxian at all, but are an expression of the political views of a certain Italian socialist school of economics (SMB) which was influential up to the 1970s. (As an aside, there are numerous Marxists who reject this school of thought, including Panzieri himself, but they cannot speak for themselves). The claim now seems to be that Panzieri's \"revolutionary theories\" show that in some important respects capitalism represents not revolution, but \"the same type of society developed by the bourgeoisie in the preceding centuries.\" (Cited by Althusser and Gramsci, Marx's Philosophy, p. 35.) This brings us to Marx's",
            "2": "nature\" and technology. Marx discusses the changing uses of these two concepts in Chapter 3 of Capital. Here he discusses the fact that the human body is the \"material world\" of capital, and therefore the \"material world\" of the capitalist social system itself. Here Marx argues that capital is \"a new instrument of the production process\" that transforms the human body into \"a material for capital\" at the cost of both the human person and the natural environment. Therefore, capitalism must destroy the body. Yet from this, Marx then points to the need to destroy the capitalist capitalist \"socially necessary means of production\" while remaining able to use those same technological means for another purpose. From this to a later part of his critique, the need for a new social basis for wealth distribution was brought into his analysis.\n\nMarx writes of the human body as part of capital:\n\n\"The human body for the capital capitalist is his entire organism \u2026 In its mechanical, chemical and nutritional conditions it"

Moreover, clinical diagnosis of T4 deficiency may be suboptimal given the lack of clinical evidence that T4 deficiency itself causes symptoms or morbidity.\n\nThe aim of this study was to compare the effects of various subacute treatments on T4 and serum TSH concentrations in hypothyroid adults aged 65 years and older, including a control group of adults age 61 years or younger.\n\nMETHODS:\n\nTo examine the effects of T4 blockade in patients and control subjects, 24 healthy elderly subjects",

(See above image of the Russian dacha neighborhoods where everyone's yard is full of food.)\n\nIf you want to develop your land for food production, the following infographic shows just how much land is needed to be self sufficient, including generating all the solar energy you need to run your home.\n\nAccording to this image, you need a mere 2 acres!",

Just last year California farmer Joel Salatin released a video showing that most of its corn and soy is genetically enhanced. But it isn't just the industrial food system that is industrializing. It is growing in cities as well, thanks to technology advances such as GPS tracking software that can pinpoint exactly where everything you eat is grown. With GPS, urban farmers are using GPS-enabled sensors to accurately trace their crops, enabling researchers to monitor pesticide use and other pollution. The technology could revolutionize food security.\n\nThe bottom line is that the current food system is driven by a business model that is fundamentally unsustainable.

Copper to aluminum batteries are ideal for general purpose applications and other batteries would be an excellent addition to those types of applications. The best part about electroplating copper is the use of a process that is available from an automotive parts or repair yard. The use of standard commercial equipment from a car parts store or auto parts supply dealer is a good alternative to purchasing the exact same parts from these places.\n\nWhen you buy some of the basic parts of your battery, it is always best to purchase the ones that are most likely to need replacement. For example an alternator should be changed every 10,000 to 20,000 miles. Since most parts of an automotive battery are expected to come apart at some point, a simple replace and replace parts system using an on-off switch can be used or even better that the parts themselves should be replaced with a new product so that new parts can be obtained."
