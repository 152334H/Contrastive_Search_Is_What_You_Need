We first acquire images of the face from a small set of viewpoints under a dense sampling of incident illumination directions using a light stage. We then construct a reflectance function image for each observed image pixel from its values over the space of illumination directions. From the reflectance functions, we can directly generate images of the face from the original viewpoints in any form of sampled or computed illumination. To change the viewpoint, we use a model of skin reflectance to estimate the appearance of the reflectance functions for novel viewpoints. We demonstrate the technique with synthetic renderings of a person's face under novel illumination and viewpoints.\n\nThe Paper\n\nSIGGRAPH 2000 Conference Proceedings The Movie\n\nSIGGRAPH 2000 Electronic Theater The Demo\n\nSIGGR",

        "reference_text": "\nA bus is a communication path between various devices of an electronic system. For example in a computer system, the central processing unit (CPU) communicates with main memory through a memory bus. Peripheral devices may also be connected to the memory bus or connected to the CPU through a separate IO bus.\n\nBuses can be divided into two general categories: point-to-point buses and shared buses. A point-to-point bus connects only two bus devices together. A shared bus can be used by more than two bus devices. Thus the number of buses required for communication depends on whether point-to-point or shared buses are used. For example, four bus devices require six point-to-point buses to communicate with each other, but four bus devices can communicate through a single shared bus. With a shared bus architecture all four bus devices can share a single bus.\n\nPoint-to-point buses have the advantage of lower latency, minimal bus contention, and the",

However, when you are 50 years old, one year has reduced to only 2% of your life, and hence seems only one-fifth as long.\n\nSummarizing this work, Freeman comes to the conclusion that the actual age (AA) needs to be corrected for the apparent length of a year (AY). The apparent length of a year is inversely proportional to one person's actual age:\n\nAY= \u03b1 /AA\n\nThe constant of proportionality \u03b1 is rather loosely defined by Freeman as the age at which a year really seems to last a year, and it was arbitrarily set at 20 years ( \u03b1 =20).\n\nNow Freeman determines the concept of Effective age, which is simply the integral over time of the Apparent Year from age 1 to the actual age (AA) of interest:\n\nAA AA EA = \u222b",

As we age, we lose muscle mass, lose bone mass, and lose bone density. As we age, our bones begin to break down, and our muscles begin to atrophy. As we age, we lose our ability to walk, and we lose our ability to run. As we age, we lose our ability to speak, and we lose our ability to read.

Back in the Game Boy Advance days, WayForward prototyped a game called Shantae 2: Risky Revolution, which was to be a sequel to the original Game Boy Color Shantae. The first world of the game was playable, and late last year, WayForward actually showed it off on a livestream for the first time.
